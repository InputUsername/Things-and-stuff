Langar.io Specification

Langar.io is a two-dimensional, stack-based esoteric programming language made by InputUsername
in 2015. It is inspired by and loosely based on the (in)famous web game Agar.io.
In Agar.io, the player controls a blob of mass and must gain mass by eating other
blobs.

The name "Langar.io" is an uncreative combination of "language" and "Agar.io".

Language overview
--
A Langar.io program consists of cells, placed on a grid. Cells are read from the
program file, left to right, top to bottom. Cells can contain numbers, actions
or nothing (empty). The player (instruction pointer) moves across the grid, one
cell at a time, consuming the contents of the cell and executing instructions
according to the contents. Most instructions operate on the stack, which is an
unbounded stack of unsigned 8-bit integers.

An example program might look something like this:

(  ) (  ) (10) (5 )
(3 ) (S ) (1 ) (10)
(1 ) (15) (  ) (W )
(S ) (  ) (5 ) (3 )

This program contains mostly rubbish, and it probably doesn't even work, but it
does present all language features:
- number cells, brackets containing any combination of digits 0-9 and spaces: (10), ( 0  ), (   1 ), (6  6  6)
- action cells, brackets containing an action and any amount of spaces: (S) or (W)
- empty cells, indicated with brackets containing optional spaces: (  )

Program execution
--
The player starts in the top-left cell. At the start of the program, the player
has 10 mass. Every step, the player consumes the cell it's on. If the cell is a
number cell, and the player's mass is larger than or equal to the cell's value,
the cell is consumed, otherwise, the program ends. Empty cells and action cells
are always consumed. After a cell is consumed, it is permanently removed from the
grid and an empty cell takes its place.

Consuming a number cell causes the player's mass to increase with the number
indicated by the cell. Additionally, it performs a function. Documentation on these
functions has not been written yet.

Action cells, when consumed, perform one of two possible actions:
- An 'S' action cell "splits" the player, dropping half of its mass in the cell it
is currently at, making that cell a number cell. The player will keep the other
half of the mass. In case the player's mass is odd, the mass will be split in two
and the player will keep the larger part.
- A 'W' action cell drops some of the player's mass in the current cell. The amount
of mass that will be dropped is indicated by the current value that resides on the
top of the stack. In case the stack is empty, the program ends. If the mass to
be dropped is larger than the player's mass, nothing happens.

When an empty cell is consumed, nothing happens. The empty cell is replaced with
another empty cell, so essentially empty cells are NOPs.

After consuming a cell, the player is ready to move on to the next cell. To do this,
it checks in every direction for a blob of mass, except for the direction it came
from in the previous step. As it's a rather confusing concept and hard to explain
in words, here is a diagram depicting the player's movement:

( ) ( ) (3) ( ) ( ) ( )
( ) ( ) (|) ( ) ( ) ( )
( ) (P) (X) (-) (5) (3)
( ) ( ) (|) ( ) ( ) ( )
( ) ( ) (W) ( ) ( ) (0)
( ) ( ) (|) ( ) (2) ( )
(S) ( ) (1) ( ) ( ) ( )

X represents the player's current location and P stands for the location in the
previous step.

As you can see in the diagram, the player checks its movement pattern along the
lines (| and -). If the check hits a number cell, it stops checking in that direction.
The check passes through empty cells (obviously) and action cells.
Once every direction has been checked, the direction pointing to the highest number
cell is selected for movement. The player then proceeds to move one cell in this
direction. In the example above, the player would move one cell to the right.
Moving costs one mass.

If the player, at any point, hits 0 (or less) mass, the program ends.

Example programs have not been written as of yet, except for the two nonsensical
examples that can be found earlier on this page.
